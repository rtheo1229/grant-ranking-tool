    ProjectName: "JA STEM Robotics",
    ProjectDescription: "About JA\nJunior Achievement USA is the nation's largest organization dedicated to giving young people the knowledge and skills they need to own their economic success, plan for their future, and make smart academic and financial choices. The mission of Junior Achievement is to inspire and prepare young people to succeed in a global economy.\nEach year, JA of OKI Partners serves over 68,000 youth in a 43-county service area in western Ohio and eastern Indiana. \nJunior Achievement (JA) empowers young people to own their economic success. Our volunteer-delivered, K-12 programs focus on career readiness, entrepreneurship, and financial literacy skills, with a focus on career-connected learning that accelerates economic opportunity and mobility for students. \nProgram\nOver the past few months, we have had two high school students who created their own non-profit working as paid interns to develop a program introducing elementary school students to robotics. Programming was developed based on First Lego League’s Robotics, with the supplemental development of a coach’s guide, and the high schoolers' plan to offer coaches training while mentoring robotics teams and judging the introductory competition.\nThe program that has been developed is an after-school STEM program for urban, inner-city students, being piloted in eight Cincinnati Public Schools (CPS) elementary schools for students in 4th through 6th grade. This program introduces the students to coding and engineering, as well as soft skills such as conflict resolution, leadership, healthy communication, and more, thanks to the development of custom programming (JA Our Team) by our District Director in Cincinnati. \nThe robotics program will be delivered over a semester which will incorporate the five (5) soft-skills lessons of the JA Our Team curriculum. Each participating school will designate a teacher to be paired with a coach from one of our JA corporate partners.  The pair will facilitate an afterschool robotics club at each school focused on STEM activities based on the First Lego League Robotics competitions. Each school will receive one First Lego Robotics kit, as well as the newly created coach's guide, the JA Our Team course materials and companion student guides.  At the end of the semester, for this pilot year JA will host its own robotics competition exclusively for the CPS students.  However, the goal is to have students eventually move on to participate in the regional competition hosted by First Lego League in the coming years.\nDelivering this programming in eight CPS elementary schools, we expect to impact 65-70 students with this programming. We plan to grow this program into all CPS elementary schools initially, then branch out to other regional school systems.",

    ProjectName: "Enrichment/ Exploration for Amity Elementary Students",
    ProjectDescription: "1. Executive Summary\n\nAmity Elementary seeks $5,000 to fund the iSPACE “Blast Off Rocketry” program for all 530 students in grades K–6. This hands-on experience will engage students in building and launching rockets while exploring Newton’s Laws of Motion, gravity, aerodynamics, and the engineering design process. The program aligns directly with Ohio’s Learning Standards for Science, Math, Technology, and Computer Science and supports our school’s goal of inspiring inquiry, collaboration, and excitement for STEM learning.\n\n2. Need for the Program\n\nWhile Amity students regularly engage in classroom science instruction, large-scale, real-world STEM applications are limited. “Blast Off Rocketry” will give every student a chance to design, test, and evaluate a rocket of their own creation—deepening understanding through inquiry and problem-solving.\nThis program supports STEM equity, ensuring all students—regardless of grade or background—participate in an authentic engineering challenge. It also strengthens Amity’s commitment to STEAM integration, critical thinking, and collaboration skills aligned with Ohio’s Portrait of a Graduate competencies.\n\n3. Program Description\n\nThe iSPACE Blast Off Rocketry program (https://ispacestem.org/products/blast-off-rocketry\n) offers two instructional formats:\n\nSingle Session (90 minutes) or Extended Session (3 hours)\n\nUp to 30 students per session, Grades PreK–9\n\nHeld on-site at Amity Elementary\n\nStudents choose Paper Rockets (for large outdoor launches) or Straw Rockets (for indoor settings).\n\nThrough this experience, students will:\n\nApply Newton’s Laws of Motion and explore the effects of force, pressure, and gravity.\n\nFollow the Engineering Design Process—plan, build, test, evaluate, and improve.\n\nIntegrate math and data analysis by recording flight distances, graphing outcomes, and comparing designs.\n\nConnect scientific principles to real-world applications in aerospace and engineering careers.\n\nTeachers will reinforce learning through pre- and post-activities on motion, measurement, and graphing, ensuring integration with Ohio standards.\n\n4. Alignment with Ohio Learning Standards\n\nThis program directly supports:\n\nOhio Science Standards (Physical Science) — motion, forces, and interactions.\n\nOhio Mathematics Standards — measurement, data collection, and graphing.\n\nOhio Technology & Computer Science Standards — modeling, iteration, and design thinking.\n\nOhio’s 21st-Century Competencies — problem-solving, communication, and collaboration.\n\nStudents will “think like scientists” by forming hypotheses, testing them through rocket launches, analyzing results, and communicating findings.\n\nYoga Mats: \nPurpose & Rationale\n\nI am writing to propose the purchase of 30 high-quality yoga mats for student use at Amity Elementary School. This initiative supports our ongoing social-emotional learning (SEL) efforts by providing structured opportunities for movement, mindfulness, and self-regulation—core components of emotional wellness and classroom engagement.\n\nOur school counselor, Mrs. McKnight, is currently completing training to become a certified yoga instructor. She plans to incorporate yoga and mindfulness into her SEL lessons, after-school enrichment offerings, and staff wellness sessions. The yoga mats will ensure that students and staff can participate safely and comfortably while maintaining a clean and consistent practice space.\n\nSupporting Research & Benefits\n\nResearch consistently supports yoga and mindfulness as evidence-based strategies that strengthen SEL outcomes and overall student well-being:\n\nA quasi-experimental study of at-risk adolescents found that a school-based yoga program improved mood, emotional regulation, and self-control compared to a standard PE class (National Library of Medicine, 2022\n).\n\nA 2024 scoping review found that yoga in elementary settings enhances SEL competencies such as self-management, empathy, and stress reduction, while supporting positive classroom behavior (Frontiers in Education, 2024\n).\n\nAccording to a white paper from the Illinois State Board of Education, yoga and mindfulness practices in schools have been shown to:\n\nReduce anxiety and depression\n\nImprove focus, attention, and academic performance\n\nSupport self-esteem and emotional regulation (ISBE Relaxation White Paper, 2023\n).\n\nThe organization YogaCalm notes that integrating yoga into classrooms supports mental health, self-regulation, and school engagement (YogaCalm Research Summary\n).\n\nThese outcomes align directly with the CASEL SEL competencies: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills, and responsible decision-making.\n\nBudget Estimate\nItem\tQuantity\tEstimated Cost (per item)\tTotal\nYoga Mats\t30\t$20–$30\t$600–$900\n\nMats will be stored centrally for shared use and can be reused for multiple years.",
    AmountRequested: "$5,000.00",
    ProjectBudget: "$5,000.00",
    Evaluation: "The Blast Off Rocketry program will be highly successful for Amity students because it transforms abstract scientific concepts into hands-on, memorable learning experiences. By designing, building, and launching their own rockets, students directly apply what they’ve learned about force, motion, gravity, and aerodynamics, bringing Ohio’s science and math standards to life in an engaging, authentic way. The collaborative nature of the activity encourages teamwork, communication, and perseverance as students test and refine their designs through the engineering design process. Each launch sparks curiosity and confidence, helping students see themselves as real scientists and engineers. This excitement will carry back into the classroom, deepening their understanding of STEM concepts and strengthening problem-solving and critical-thinking skills. Ultimately, the program will not only build academic knowledge but also inspire a lasting love of learning and discovery among all Amity students.\n\nUnder Mrs. McKnight’s leadership, yoga and mindfulness will be woven into multiple areas of school life:\n\nSEL Lessons: During counseling sessions, Mrs. McKnight will lead short yoga or breathing exercises to teach students how to calm their bodies and focus their minds.\n\nAfter-School Enrichment: A new “Mindful Movement Club” will offer yoga to students across grade levels, providing an inclusive opportunity for movement and mindfulness practice.\n\nStaff Wellness: Mrs. McKnight will also lead optional yoga sessions for staff to promote self-care, team building, and modeling of SEL strategies.\n\nGeneral Use: Mats will be available for classroom teachers to check out for brain breaks, morning meetings, or calm-down corners."

    ProjectName: "QCBB's New Curated Book Distribution Program Growth in 2025-2026 School Year",
    ProjectDescription: "Decades of research have confirmed the correlation between childhood poverty, lack of resources, low reading proficiency and the resulting struggle to complete high school. Local statistics that portray the need for reliable, quality book access locally include:\n\n*Up to 40% of CPS third graders are not proficient readers, a statistic that has remained static for many years. \n*In at least eight local school districts, 70% or more of the student population is economically disadvantaged,\ntranslating to a sustained lack of resources.\n*Children who do not read on level by Grade 3 have only a 1 in 8 chance of ever catching up and are 4x less\nlikely to graduate high school.\n*A child in a low-income family enters first grade with an average of 25 hours of one-to-one picture book\nreading, compared to 1,700 hours from a middle-class home.\n\nThere is an ensemble of factors that lead to literacy success, but one of the most critical factors is book access. To realize their potential as readers, children must have personal libraries. There is tremendous importance in book ownership as it promotes habits that enhance reading, education and job readiness. When children have as few as 20 books of their own, they achieve three more years of schooling than children who do not have any books at home.\n\nPreviously fragmented book distribution efforts reached a small percentage of at-risk children and book drives yield few diverse or bilingual books. To respond to this resourcing challenge, QCBB provides an innovative solution to a critical literacy resource gap. We purchase new books and intentionally select books that resonate with K-3rd grade students in our program who lack consistent book access. This unique model allows designated teachers to access our online portal and select books of interest to their students at an\nappropriate reading level. This curated approach fosters specific interests and needs of each child and provides 10 new books per year for their at-home libraries.\n\nIn 24-25, this program served 3,258 K-3rd grade students in 17 schools and 155 classrooms. Schools in this program are located in Hamilton, Kenton and Campbell counties.\n\nIn the 25-26 school year, we have grown the New Curated Book Program to 20 schools and approximately 4,000 students. Schools include: Carson, Ethel Taylor, Latonia, Leap, Lincoln Heights, Newport Primary, Newport Intermediate, Oyler, Roberts, Rockdale, St. Francis Seraph, Taft, Ninth District, St. Lawrence, Regeneration, Rees E. Price, Roll Hill, Corryville Catholic, John G. Carlisle Elementary, and Woodford Academy.\n\nThis funding will support the expansion of our signature New Curated Book Distribution Program in the 2025-2026 school year. More specifically, this grant will help fund our two major program expenses associated with QCBB’s New Curated Book Distribution Program: new high-quality books and staff salaries to grow the program.\n\n-New, High-Quality Books: The unique aspect of the program is that we can provide new, high-quality books with characters and authors of all different backgrounds, bi-lingual books, different topics and levels. We work with First Book, Book Depot and publishers to buy quality, discounted books. We will continue to work diligently to reduce the average cost of a book by demonstrating to booksellers that we are helping to create future readers.\n-Salaries: The other largest expense is staff time to onboard new schools, order books, inventory/upload books to software, pull and package books and deliver to schools each month. Staff also recruit schools, distribute surveys and compile results. We also work to utilize skilled volunteers to maximize our reach with limited resources.\n\nWe will remain methodical with growth so that we can better understand the distinct needs of families. We strive to enhance book access in the home, at school and in the community through our comprehensive approach. By leveraging the unique contributions of our neighbors, we can expand this program and scale the impact.",

    Evaluation: "While it is challenging to isolate the impact of book access because of the many factors that contribute to reading success, we work to measure beyond volumetric results through biannual teacher/principal surveys, an annual parent survey and teacher videos.\n\nSurveys and Video Feedback: Since launching the curated book distribution program, we have used feedback from parents and teachers to make improvements. This includes biannual teacher surveys, year-end parent surveys, and impact videos from teachers. Questions focus on reading frequency, motivation, and sharing. Coordinators also track Oyler School families for long-term study. Results are compiled into an annual report and summary video, with parent and teacher input being most valuable.\n\nResults from the 24-25 school year were as follows:\n-97% of parents say child is more motivated to read\n-100% of teachers say students are more engaged reading in class.\n-97% of parents say child is reading more frequently.\n-93% of parents say child is reading more with family.\n\nVerbatims and stories are the most valuable feedback. They provide authentic insights into families’ real experiences—what works, challenges, and how the program impacts their child's/student’s reading journey. By leveraging parent and teacher insights about the students, we are able to foster their individual educational journey for each child and enhance the home reading environment for families.\n\nOne favorite Teacher quote last year:\n-I observed a remarkable increase in student engagement during reading — greater than at any other point in my teaching career. I believe this is largely due to students seeing themselves reflected in the texts. Third grade represents a pivotal stage in development, as students begin to mature beyond early elementary interests. At this age, books featuring cartoon characters or animals often lose their appeal. Instead, students seek relatable content that fosters personal connection, and your books provide exactly that.\n\nTwo favorite Parent quotes last year:\n-Because of these books, my son is more motivated to learn to read and relate to his classmates — a thousand thanks! (Spanish Speaking Family)\n-Receiving her own books has improved her language and reading skills. It has also allowed me to develop a special bond with my child, while improving her imagination and creativity and preparing her for academic success.\n\nVideo Summary 2024-2025: https://youtu.be/faySFRXAYEA\n\nThese are just a few of the many impactful statements collected each year that highlight the deep and lasting impact of this program. Voices of families guide our growth, while the dedication of 1,500+ volunteers who support book distribution make this work possible. By analyzing past outcomes, we are able to estimate future growth, make data-informed improvements each year, and ensure the program evolves to meet families’ needs. \n\nWe aim to achieve the following results in the 25-26 school year:\n-Distribute over 40,000 new curated books (10 books to approximately 4,000 students)\n-95% of teacher responses show students have more interest in reading by end of year\n-90% of parent responses will show increased reading at home by end of year\n-Share Impact verbatims\n-Engage 1,500 volunteers to support book distribution\n\nThank you for considering a partnership with Queen City Book Bank. This initiative thrives because of the shared commitment and support of our community, and we are grateful for your interest in helping us continue this important work."

    ProjectName: "Museum Trip Buses",
    ProjectDescription: "I would like to take my 44 second grade students and multiple parent chaperones to the Cincinnati Museum Center.  They have three museums included in admission along with a cool Omnimax add-on.  I teach in a low socioeconomic school where the majority of students are on free and reduced lunch.  We are a walking district and don't have any buses.  We have a large class this year and need two buses which is out of our price range.  Please help us to get a more hands-on look at science, history, and an amazing children's museum. Our students often don't leave Norwood, so any opportunity we can to get them out of the city, we sign up to do.",
    AmountRequested: "$600.00",
    ProjectBudget: "$600.00",
    Evaluation: "We need the $600 to pay for the two buses to and from the museum center.  We would also be happy for $300 to help pay for one of the buses. The Museum of Natural History & Science at Cincinnati Museum Center offers a world of science, history and nature through interactive exhibits and amazing artifacts. We encourage kids to climb, crawl, explore and learn about themselves and the world around them. Go on a wilderness adventure through The Woods, be a part of a complex machine in the Energy Zone and explore the neighborhood in Kids’ Town. Dive into arts, culture, reading, science and more with over 1,800 hours of programming each year.  We can only get to this amazing museum with your help!  Thanks so much for considering."
